# OOPFinalProject: Ticket Management System

Welcome to our final project! This repository contains an **interactive ticket management interface**, designed for businesses to report issues, assign fixes, and track progress efficiently.

## 📋 Project Overview

Our goal is to create an interface where users can:
- Report issues or bugs (as "tickets")
- Assign tickets to users
- Track the progress and urgency of each ticket
- Comment on tickets
- (Optional) Restrict certain actions to assigned users for enhanced control

This system is adaptable for business environments where issue tracking, accountability, and progress visibility are essential.

## 🧩 Key Objects

- **Ticket**: Represents a user-reported issue that needs to be fixed.
  - **Attributes**:
    - Assigned User
    - Status (fixed or not)
    - Urgency
    - Process Stage (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`)
    - Comments

## 🚀 Core Functionalities

- **Create Ticket**: Users can report a new issue.
- **Assign/Re-assign Ticket**: Assign tickets to users or change assignment as needed.
- **Set Urgency**: Users can specify the urgency of each ticket.
- **Track Process**: Set and update the process stage (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`).
- **Commenting**: Users can comment under any ticket for collaboration.
- **(Optional)**: Only the assigned user can change the ticket's process stage.

## 🏢 Business Use Case

This project is tailored for business use, focusing on:
- Smooth issue reporting and assignment
- Clear tracking of progress for each ticket
- Enhanced collaboration and accountability
